<details>

<summary><em>Cursor Not Displaying</em></summary>

If you are experiencing an issue where the cursor does not appear on your server, it may be due to the use of a function called `ShutdownLoadingScreenNui();` in a loading screen. This function removes the cursor from the user interface framework. Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

1. **Navigate to Your Loading Script Folder**: Locate your loading script folder and find the client script file. The file is usually named `client.lua`, but it may have a different name.
2. **Open the Client Script**: Open the client script file in a text editor. We recommend using Visual Studio Code, but any text editor will work.
3. **Locate the `ShutdownLoadingScreenNui()` Function**: Search for the function `ShutdownLoadingScreenNui()` in the client script.
4.  **Comment Out the Function**: Once you have located the function, comment it out by adding two dashes (`--`) before the function name. This will disable the function and prevent it from removing the cursor.

    ```lua
    -- ShutdownLoadingScreenNui();
    ```
5. **Save the Changes**: After commenting out the function, save the changes to the client script file.
6. **Restart Your Server**: Restart your server for the changes to take effect.

After completing these steps, the cursor should now display properly on your server. If you continue to experience issues, double-check the changes and ensure the server has been restarted properly.

            url = "https://discord.gg/RquDVTfDwu"  -- Button link
        },
        button2 = {
            enabled = true,

            url = "fivem://connect/IP:30120"  -- FiveM direct connect URL
        }
    }
}
```

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Setting Up Discord Application

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name.
3. Copy the `Application ID` and paste it into the `clientid` field in the config.

#### 2. Customizing Rich Presence

* **Player Display Format:**
  * Modify the `displayPlayingAs` field to change how player information appears.
  *   Example:

      ```lua
      displayPlayingAs = "Active: %s | Role: %s"
      ```
* **Icons:**
  * Change the small and big icon URLs by uploading your own image to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or any direct image host.

#### 3. Configuring Discord Buttons

* Ensure `discordButtons.enabled` is set to `true` to activate buttons.
* Modify the labels and URLs to fit your server's needs.
*   Example of button configuration:

    ```lua
    button1 = {
        label = "Join Discord",
        url = "https://discord.gg/YOURSERVER"
    }
    ```
